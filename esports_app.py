If "Teamplay" is true, use "LookupTournamentTeamResultsByTournamentId" to retrieve results, and "LookupTournamentTeamPlayersByTournamentId" to retrieve players for those results.
Individual-based tournaments and team-based tournaments have two completely different methods of accounting for unknown players. See the notes of those methods for more information.

LookupTournamentResultsByTournamentId

LookupTournamentResultsByTournamentId returns a list of tournament placements for tournaments held between individuals (1v1, FFA). Use this method if "Teamplay" is set to false.

Parameters:
apikey - The unique API Key associated with your account.
format - Format of the output. (default: JSON)
tournamentid - The unique ID associated with the tournament on the website.
Output:
Ranking - Number that determines ordering on the list. Ranks 1, 2 and 3 are also used to show a gold, silver and bronze background respectively.
RankText - Formatted text associated with the player's placement in the tournament.
TeamId - Unique identification number associated with a team on the site.
TeamName - Name of the player's associated team.
PlayerId - Unique identification number associated with a player on the site.
CountryCode - Two-letter country code based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard.

NameLast - Player's last name.
CurrentHandle - Player's currently used in-game handle or ID.
ShowLastNameFirst - Boolean determining whether or not the last name should be displayed before the first name.
PrizeUSD - Prize money awarded to the player in US Dollars.
Notes:
For v0 of the API, "TeamId" and "TeamName" may not work as intended. The site currently has an unreliable method of determining team associations from individual and team earnings. This will be rectified in v1.
If a placement is associated with an unknown player, the "CurrentHandle" will be "##UNKNOWN##". "PlayerId" in this instance is only used to return a unique row for each unknown player and can be discarded.

LookupTournamentTeamResultsByTournamentId

LookupTournamentTeamResultsByTournamentId returns a list of tournament placements for tournaments held between teams (2v2, 5v5, etc.). Use this method if "Teamplay" is set to true.

Parameters:
apikey - The unique API Key associated with your account.
format - Format of the output. (default: JSON)
tournamentid - The unique ID associated with the tournament on the website.
Output:
Ranking - Number that determines ordering on the list. Ranks 1, 2 and 3 are also used to show a gold, silver and bronze background respectively.
RankText - Formatted text associated with the player's placement in the tournament.
TeamId - Unique identification number associated with a team on the site.
TeamName - Name of the player's associated team.
TournamentTeamId - Unique identification number associated with a team earning on the site. Not to be confused with "TeamId".
TournamentTeamName - Name of the team associated with the team placement.
PrizeUSD - Prize money awarded to the team in US Dollars. Divide this value by the number of players + UnknownPlayerCount to get the prize per player.
UnknownPlayerCount - Number of unknown players on the team. Used if the full roster of the team is not known to correct division with PrizeUSD.
Notes:
For v0 of the API, "TeamId" and "TeamName" may not work as intended. The site currently has an unreliable method of determining team associations for individual and team earnings. This will be rectified in v1.
"TournamentTeamId" refers to a team earning for a single tournament, while "TeamId" refers to a team record on the site.
"TournamentTeamName" is the name of the team specifically for the associated tournament. It may include the title sponsor where appropriate (Fnatic.MSI for Fnatic), or may not be associated with a team at all, such as an all-stars match or two players pairing up for a 2v2 tournament.
The "LookupTournamentTeamResultsByTournamentId" method should be called along with "LookupTournamentTeamPlayersByTournamentId". Use "TournamentTeamId" to associate players with their respective team earning.
Formula for calculating prize money for each player: PrizeUSD / (Number of known players + UnknownPlayerCount)
Number of known players retrieved from the "LookupTournamentTeamPlayersByTournamentId" method may be zero for some tournaments, and "UnknownPlayerCount" is usually zero. Ensure that you are not dividing by zero!

LookupTournamentTeamPlayersByTournamentId

LookupTournamentTeamPlayersByTournamentId returns a list of players associated with the "tournament teams" of a tournament. Use this method if "Teamplay" is set to true.

Parameters:
apikey - The unique API Key associated with your account.
format - Format of the output. (default: JSON)
tournamentid - The unique ID associated with the tournament on the website.
Output:
TournamentTeamId - Unique identification number associated with a team earning on the site. Used to group players with their associated team earning.
PlayerId - Unique identification number associated with a player on the site.
CountryCode - Two-letter country code based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard.
NameFirst - Player's first name.
NameLast - Player's last name.
CurrentHandle - Player's currently used in-game handle or ID.
ShowLastNameFirst - Boolean determining whether or not the last name should be displayed before the first name.
Notes:
The "LookupTournamentTeamPlayersByTournamentId" method should be called along with "LookupTournamentTeamResultsByTournamentId". Use "TournamentTeamId" to associate players with their respective team earning.
Some team-based tournaments will return team earnings, but not players for those team earnings. This is because information on player rosters for those tournaments have not been added yet.

LookupHighestEarningTeams

LookupHighestEarningTeams returns a list of 100 teams with the highest overall prize money won.

Parameters:
apikey - The unique API Key associated with your account.

TeamName - Name of the team.
TotalUSDPrize - Total prize won by the team in US Dollars.
TotalTournaments - Total number of tournaments that a team received prize money in.

TeamName - Name of the team.
TotalUSDPrize - Total prize won by the team for the game in US Dollars.
TotalTournaments - Total number of tournaments for the game that a team received prize money in.

If the query mentions a player name (e.g., 'TenZ'), prioritize LookupPlayerById or LookupPlayerTournaments and set 'playerid' to the player name.
If the query references a game name, set 'gameid' to that name (e.g., 'valorant').
For match history, prefer LookupPlayerTournaments to get the latest tournament.

If the user references a game name, set \"gameid\" to that name (e.g. \"valorant\"), and we will resolve it from the csv.
If the user references a player name use LookupPlayerById.
Return ONLY a valid JSON object in this format:
{{
  \"endpoint\": \"<API_METHOD>\",
  \"params\": {{
    \"gameid\": \"valorant\",
    \"offset\": 0,
    \"tournamentid\": \"1234\"
